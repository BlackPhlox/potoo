The Cursed Editor for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org)

Plan is to migrate [bevy_cursed_editor](https://github.com/BlackPhlox/bevy_cursed_editor) and split `bevy_codegen` out to a seperate repository once `potoo` as at MVP.

- Uses [hot-lib-reloader](https://github.com/rksm/hot-lib-reloader-rs) for hot-reloading allowing for faster iteration times of your bevy applications.

- Some things like data structures cannot be changed during hot-reloading runtime, `potoo` knows this as it know about the code and reloads your entire application, to reduce friction.

- Project files will be saved as `.po2`, which will include version check for compatibility and auto-conversion.
